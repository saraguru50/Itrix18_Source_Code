Hyperlink cycle: (Level 2)


This is an algorithmic and a famous graph theory question.

The task is so simple..We have to find if the given undirected graph contains any odd length cycle or not

In other words, we have to check if the graph is bipartite graph or not.

This is a graph coloring problem. Start colouring the nodes of the graph with two colours '1' and '0'. 

If any two adjacent nodes have the same color ('1','1') or ('0','0'), then we can conclude that the given graph has an odd length cycle.

The coloring of the nodes can be done in a single dfs and so the overall time complexity is O(n + m) where n and m are the number of nodes and edges in the given undirected graph respectively.

The answer for this challenge is nothing but the md5sum of the output of the program.

Eg:    cat Challenge6_Testcases | ./exec_file | md5sum


As simple as that!!!!!
