Input format:

		First line contains a single integer T (<= 50) which denotes the number of test cases.
		For each test case, 
				The first line contains two integers n (<= 50) and m (<= 50) which denotes the number of nodes and number of edges in the graph respectively.

				Next m lines contains two integers u (<= n) and v (<= n) denoting an undirected edge between the two nodes 'u' and 'v'.

Output format:
		
		For each test case, print "YES" if there is an odd length cycle and "NO" if there is no odd cycle in the graph in a new line.
