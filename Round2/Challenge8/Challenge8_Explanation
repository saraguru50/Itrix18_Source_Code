JPEG Recovery:


This is the hardest question of the contest :):)

Here you are given two image files.. One is a normal JPG file and the other one is a corrupted JPG file which has the answer for the challenge.

Let's try to analyse the binary data of the two given image files..

The image file is corrupted and this may happen due to change in the signature bytes of the image file..

So, lets analyse the signature bytes of the given image files...

The corrupted JPG image file's first few signature bytes are:

    0000 0000 0010 0111 0000 0000 0001 1111 1111 1111

The normal JPG image file's first few signature bytes are:

    1111 1111 1101 1000 1111 1111 1110 0000 0000 0000
    
The entire clue is visible from the signature bytes of both the image files :):)

The entire corrupted image file is just complemented....ie) ('1' became '0' and '0' became '1')

So, lets write a python script and read byte by byte from the corrupted image file. Let's complement each byte and then write it in a new image file to get the answer for this challenge......

As simple as that!!!!!
