Reverse It :):) (Level 2)


This challenge is similar to the challenge2 where we tried to reverse the given C++ Program.

Here in addition to reversing, we have to first deobfuscate the given code to get the logic of the program.

The logic of the program is quite simple. 

Take the string given in the if condition, 'xsetczrwlcpsatncldplndfzxlqpsedtdtse'

Reverse the above string.

Shift each of the character in the above reversed string to 15 characters. ie) 'x' + 15 = 'm', 's' + 15 = 'h' and so on

The final string that you will get is an interesting string :):)

'Thisisthefamouscaesarcipheralgorithm'

Execute the given C++ Program and give input as the above string and you will get the answer :):)


As simple as that!!!!!!
