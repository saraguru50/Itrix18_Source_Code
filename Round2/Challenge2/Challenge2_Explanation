Reverse It: (Level 1)

This is a source code reversing challenge :):)

Here a C++ program is given and we have to figure out the correct input that has to be provided for the program, to get the answer for this challenge.

The logic of this program is quite simple.

Take the number '42673239' that is checked in the if condition in the given C++ program. Swap the adjacent bits in the binary representation of the above number. ie) (swap 0th bit and 1st bit, 2nd bit and 3rd bit, ........ 30th bit and 31st bit)

The resulting number is an interesting number, 21436587

Execute the given C++ program and supply input as 21436587 and you will get the answer :):)

As simple as that!!!!!
