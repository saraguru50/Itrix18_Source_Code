Execute It:

This is a simple reverse engineering task.

You are given an executable file named 'exec' and you have to try to get the flag from the executable file.

The first unix command that comes to our mind when we speak about reverse engineering is the 'strings' command.

Yes..thats it...Type 'strings exec' and you will get the answer for the challenge.



(Note:  strings command will display all the strings present in your program like 

printf("Hello World"); cout << "Welcome";  etc...)
