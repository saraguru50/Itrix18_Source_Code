WEB CHALLENGES:


1) What is the syntax used to perform multi-line commenting in a html document?  (Mark 1)

Options:

a) <!/*            */>
b) <!//            //>
c) <!--           -->
d) <!””           “”>


2) What will be ouput of the following javascript code?  (Mark 2)

<script>
	var s1 = ‘0’;
	var s2 = false;
	if(s1 == s2) {
		alert(“hi”);
	}
	if(s1 === s2) {
		alert(“hello”);
	}
</script>

3) Whatwill the following javascript code output to the console?   (Mark 3)

<script>
var arr1 = "john".split('');
var arr2 = arr1.reverse();
var arr3 = "jones".split('');
arr2.push(arr3);
console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));
console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));
</script>

4) What will the following javascript code output to the console? (Mark 3)
<script>
var a={},
   b={key:'b'},
   c={key:'c'};

a[b]=123;
a[c]=456;

console.log(a[b]);
</script>
 
5) How about doing ssome reverse engineering to the php code???  (Mark 5)
You are given a Php code and you have to give the correct input to the code to generate the output.
<?php
	$str = bin2hex($x);
	$str1 = strrev($str);
	if($str1 == “5444f434058405”) {
		echo “Well done!!”;
	}
	else {
		echo “Try again”;
	}

?>
What is the value of ‘x’ in the above code to have the if statement get executed??
(Reference:    
	bin2hex() function displays the characters of the string in its ascii value in hex format
 )

6)  You are given the following html code..  (Mark 5)
<html>
	<script>
		function func() {
			// Complete the following code
		}
	</script>
	<body bgcolor=”skyblue”>
		Enter a text: <input type=”text” value=”hello” id=”t1”> <br><br>
		<button onclick=func();>  Submit </button> <br><br>
		<p id=”p”></p>
	</body>

</html>
When the user clicks the submit button, the value of the text box “hello” has to appended to the paragraph tag... Write the javascript function func()   to do the above task...

7)  You are given an empty php file named ‘sample.php’ and a html file  ‘request.html’. (Mark 8)

Sample.php
<?php
	// Complete the following code
?>

Request.html
<html>
	<script>
		function func() {
			//Complete the following code
		}
	</script>
	<body bgcolor=”skyblue”>
		<p id=”p”> welcome to the html file</p>
		<button onclick=func();> Submit </button>
	</body>
</html>

In the above example, when the user clicks the submit button, the text in the paragraph tag has to taken to the javascript function. 
Write an ajax request in the javascript function func() to the ‘sample.php’ file and send the text along with the request. Convert the text to upper case in the php file and send the response back to javascript function func(). Finally replace the response with the text in the paragraph tag.

ALGORITHMIC CHALLENGES:

1) Analyse the function performed by the following snippet:) (Mark 3)
int function(int n) {
	int count = 0;
	 while (n) {
    		count += n & 1;
    		n >>= 1;
  	}
	return count;
}
What is the value returned by the above function??

2)  Caesar cipher is a well known encryption algorithm which works by shifting the given message by a specified number of characters. (Eg:    message = “abcde”, shift = 3, encrypted text = “defgh”)
(Explanation:     ‘a’ + 3 = ‘d’,    ‘b’ + 3 = ‘e’,   ‘c’  + 3 = ‘f’ ,    ‘d’ + 3 = ‘g’,     ‘e’ + 3 = ‘h’  )

In this problem, you are given a message and an encrypted text and your task is to find the possible shifts that it can have.     (Mark 2)

Plain text         =  “caesar cipher algorithm”
Encrypted text =  “rpthpg rxewtg pavdgxiwb”

i) 25      ii) 378      iii)  15      iv)  405
Options:
a) Only i)
b) Both iii) and ii)
c) Both iii) and iv)
d) None of the above
 
3) Write a program to detect a cycle in an undirected graph as well as directed graph.    (Mark 5)
(Function part is sufficient but do cover all the corner cases to get the full score:):)


4) You are given an n * m matrix where ‘n’ and ‘m’ denote the number of rows and columns in the matrix. Each cell in the matrix has a positive integer and you are currently in the cell (1,1) and you have to go the cell (n,m). From your current cell, you can only go to the right and down cells. What a program to find the maximum amount of points that you can get by traversing through the matrix???   (Mark 8)

(Note: 
	* You can visit a cell only once	
	*  When you visit a cell, the integer in the cell is added to your total points
	*  You have to reach the cell (n,m) from (1,1) 
 ) 

5)   You are given a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n and m pairs of positions (aj, bj).
At each step you can choose a pair from the given positions and swap the numbers in that positions. What is the lexicographically maximal permutation one can get?Let p and q be two permutations of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n. p is lexicographically smaller than the q if a number 1 ≤ i ≤ n exists, so pk = qk for 1 ≤ k < i and pi < qi.
Write a program to find the lexicographically maximal permutation that you can get??   (Mark 10)
Sample:
Input
9 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 4
4 7
2 5
5 8
3 6
6 9
Output
7 8 9 4 5 6 1 2 3


6) What will be the output for the following code snippet?? (Mark 3)
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>

    using namespace std;

    int main() {
	int k = 8;
int x = 0 == 1 && k++;
printf("%d%d\n", x, k);
}

7) What will be output of the following code snippet?? (Mark 3)
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int i = 20,j;
	i = (printf("Hello"), printf(" All Geeks "));
	printf("%d", i);
	return 0;
}

   
8) Write a program to remove every kth node in a linked..(Mark 5)
(Do cover all the test cases to get the maximum score :):)

Eg:)         Input : 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8  
        K = 3
 
        Output : 1->2->4->5->7->8

9) Write a program to find the diameter of the binary tree..(Mark 5)
The structure of the binary tree is,
struct node {
	int data;
	struct node *left, *right;
}

10) You are given a 2D matrix where each cell in the matrix contains an integer (not necessarily positive)   (Mark 10)
Your task is to write a program that will find the maximum rectangle sum in the matrix.
Eg:            [1,2,-1,-4,-20
                  -8,-3,4,2,1
                   3,8,10,1,3
                   -4,-1,1,7,-6]

The bolded rectangle in the above example has the maximum sum of all the submatrices.

-3 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 10 + 1 -1 + 1 + 7 = 29

11) Now for the last one, we have an interesting game theory question:):)
You are given string consisting of lowercase letters. Two players A and B wants to play a game with the string. During a player’s turn, he can choose any alphabet which is currently present in the string and remove any number of that particular character from the string. The player who cannot make the move will lose the game. Player A will start the game always. Write a program to predict who will be the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.     (Mark 6)
Sample:
Input:
cabccabbccba
Output:
Player A wins the game

Input:
bbcaccbcbc
Output:
Player B wins the game
